# Ant Colony Optimization

This repository contains a computer program that implements the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm and includes variations of the algorithm for different problem domains. The implementation is based on the concepts described in the book "ACO" by Marco Dorigo and Thomas Stutzle.

## Introduction

Ant Colony Optimization is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It utilizes the concept of pheromone trails to find optimal solutions for various optimization problems. This repository provides an implementation of the ACO algorithm and its variations.

## Variations

This repository includes the following variations of the ACO algorithm:

### Double Bridge Experiment

The double bridge experiment is a classic example used to study the optimization capabilities of ant colonies. It demonstrates how ants can find the shortest path between two points by using probabilistic rules based on local information. The implementation for this variation can be found in the [double_bridge](double_bridge) subfolder.

### [Add Your Variation]

Feel free to add your own variations of the ACO algorithm by creating a new subfolder and implementing the necessary code.

## Usage

Each variation of the ACO algorithm has its own implementation and usage instructions. Refer to the respective subfolders for detailed information on running and customizing the algorithms.
