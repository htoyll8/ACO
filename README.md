# Multi-Heuristics in Ant Colony Optimization

This repository contains a computer program that implements the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm with multi-heuristics, specifically targeting the sequential ordering problem with constraints. The implementation is based on the concepts described in the book "ACO" by Marco Dorigo and Thomas Stutzle.

## Introduction

Ant Colony Optimization is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It utilizes the concept of pheromone trails to find optimal solutions for various optimization problems. In the context of the sequential ordering problem with constraints, the ACO algorithm is enhanced with multi-heuristics, allowing ants to explore different regions of the solution space based on different trade-offs and preferences.

## Multi-Heuristics in ACO

In traditional ACO, ants rely on pheromone levels and heuristic information to make probabilistic decisions during the construction of solutions. The heuristic information guides ants towards more promising solutions based on domain-specific knowledge. In the multi-heuristics version of ACO, ants are equipped with multiple heuristics that represent different objectives or preferences. By considering different trade-offs, the algorithm explores different regions of the search space, potentially finding near-optimal solutions that exhibit different characteristics. These solutions may not satisfy everyone's requirements perfectly, but they provide a range of alternatives that capture different trade-offs and preferences.

## Sequential Ordering Problem with Constraints

The sequential ordering problem with constraints involves arranging a set of elements in a particular order while satisfying certain constraints. The constraints can be defined based on ordering preferences, dependencies, or other requirements specific to the problem. The ACO algorithm with multi-heuristics for this problem aims to find a solution that respects the given ordering constraints while optimizing the objective function.

## Usage

The implementation of the ACO algorithm with multi-heuristics for the sequential ordering problem with constraints can be found in the provided code files. The usage instructions and customization options are described within the code. You can run the code with your own problem instances and adjust the parameters according to your requirements.
