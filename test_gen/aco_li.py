"""
This code is inspired by the paper "Software Test Data Generation using Ant 
Colony Optimization" by Huaizhong Li and C. Peng Lam. The paper proposes the 
use of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for software test data generation. 
It introduces the concept of ants exploring a graph representation of the 
program under test, leaving pheromone traces and finding optimal solutions. 
The code implements the key concepts of ACO, such as ant movement, 
pheromone update, transition feasibility, and termination conditions. 
It adapts the ACO algorithm described in the paper to the specific problem 
of generating test data based on a UML Statechart diagram. By incorporating 
ideas from this research, the code aims to improve the automation and efficiency 
of test data generation in software testing.
